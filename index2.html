     I can too!(ICT) is an established organization dedicated to aiding educational programs help reach minority and marginalized students by creating a database where those companies can post their information. I can Too! was created in August 2018 by Alex,iles Smallhorne and Miles Barksdale with the purpose of helping create an edge for minority students in job industries that are in high demand. We realized that finding programs targeting minorities was very difficult and there needed to be a way for students to find programs that  would be servicable for them.
