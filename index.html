       </p>
       <p id="para">I can too!(ICT) is an established organization dedicated to aiding educational programs 
         help reach minority and marginalized students by creating a database where those companies can 
         post their information. I can Too! was created in August 2018 by Alex Covarrubias, Miles Smallhorne, and 
         Miles Barksdale with the purpose of helping create an edge for minority students in job industries 
         that are in high demand. We realized that finding programs targeting minorities was very difficult and 
         there needed to be a way for students to find programs that  would be servicable for them. A public database that 
         showcases educational programs should be created for these students and we took it upon ourselves to create the public database.
